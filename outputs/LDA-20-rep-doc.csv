Managers need practical tools for selecting among these actions and strategies to develop a tailored management approach for specific targets at a given location. We developed and present one such tool, the participatory Adaptation for Conservation Targets (ACT) framework, which considers the effects of climate change in the development of management actions for particular species, ecosystems and ecological functions. Our framework is based on the premise that effective adaptation of management to climate change can rely on local knowledge of an ecosystem and does not necessarily require detailed projections of climate change or its effects. We illustrate the ACT framework by applying it to an ecological function in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, USA)--water flows in the upper Yellowstone River. We suggest that the ACT framework is a practical tool for initiating adaptation planning, and for generating and communicating specific management interventions given an increasingly altered, yet uncertain, climate."

Here, models for molten MgSiO3 are computed employing empirical potential molecular dynamics (EPMD) and results are compared to published results including two EPMD studies and three first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) models and to laboratory data. The EPMD results derived from the Oganov (OG) potential come closest to the density of MgSiO3 liquid at the 1-bar melting point inferred from the melting curve. At higher P, EPMD densities calculated from the OG potential and FPMD broadly match shock wave studies, with the OG potential yielding the better comparison. Matsui (M) potential results deviate from other studies above º50GPa. Overall, results based on the OG potential compare best to experimental densities over the PT range of the mantle. Isothermally, upon increasing P the mean coordination numbers ( CN ) of oxygen around Si and Mg monotonically increase with pressure. Tetrahedral Si and octahedral Si monotonically increase and decrease, respectively, whereas pentahedral Si maximizes at 1020GPa. Tetrahedral Mg decreases monotonically as P increases whereas pentahedral, octahedral and higher coordination polyhedra each show similar behavior first increasing and then decreasing after attaining a maximum; the P of the maximum for each polyhedra type migrates to higher P as the CN increases. Free oxygen and oxygen with one nearest neighbor of either Si or Mg decreases whereas Si or Mg with two or three nearest oxygens (i.e., tricluster oxygen) increases with increasing P isothermally. The increase of tricluster oxygen is consistent with spectroscopy on MgSiO3 glass quenched from 2000K and 040GPa and high-energy X-ray studies constraining the coordination of O around Mg and around Si at 2300K and 1bar. Coordination statistics from FPMD studies for O around Si and Si around O are in agreement with the EPMD results based on the M and OG potentials. Mg self-diffusivity is greater than O and Si self-diffusivities for both the M and OG potentials. All D values monotonically decrease with increasing pressure isothermally and all atoms are more diffusive in the M liquid compared to the OG liquid except at T >º5000K and P >100GPa. Previously published EPMD diffusivities fall between values given by the M and OG potentials, at least up to 45GPa. The M liquid is generally less viscous than the OG liquid except at P >º80GPa. Activation energy and volume are around 96kJ/mol and 1.5cm3/mol, respectively. The FPMD viscosity results at 120GPa and 4000 and 4500K are essentially identical to the values from the M and OG potentials. FPMD viscosity results are similar to the OG results for P <60GPa; at higher P, the FPMD viscosities are higher. At 4000K and 100GPa the shear viscosity of liquid MgSiO3 is º0.1Pas. More extensive laboratory results are required to better define the thermodynamic, transport and structural properties of MgSiO3 liquids and for comparison with computational studies."

Here, in situ monazite U(Th)Pb geochronology is combined with metamorphic pressure and temperature estimates to constrain pressuretemperaturetime (PTt) paths for both the hangingwall and footwall rocks of a Miocene ductile component of the STDS (outer STDS) now exposed in the eastern Himalaya. The outer STDS is located south of a younger, ductile/brittle component of the STDS (inner STDS), and is characterized by structurally upward decreasing metamorphic grade corresponding to a transition from sillimanite-bearing Greater Himalayan sequence rocks in the footwall with garnet that preserves diffusive chemical zoning to staurolite-bearing Chekha Group rocks in the hangingwall, with garnet that records prograde chemical zoning. Monazite ages indicate that prograde garnet growth in the footwall occurred prior to partial melting at 22.6 0.4 Ma, and that peak temperatures were reached following c. 20.5 Ma. In contrast, peak temperatures were reached in the Chekha Group hangingwall by c. 22 Ma. Normal-sense (top-to-the-north) shearing in both the hangingwall and footwall followed peak metamorphism from c. 23 Ma until at least c. 16 Ma. Retrograde PTt paths are compatible with modelled PTt paths for an outer STDS analogue that is isolated from the inner STDS by intervening extrusion of a dome of mid-crustal material."

The evolution of the river was analyzed based on digital elevation models, remotely sensed imagery, hydrometric data, and a hydraulic model. The response varies along the river. Near the river mouth, where incision rate is high and a deep channel forms, overbank flooding is less likely. There, large floods exert high shear stress within the confined channel, increasing sinuosity. Upstream, near the migrating knickzone channel gradients also increase, incision is more moderate and floods continue to overtop the banks, favoring meander chute cutoffs. The resulting channel has a downstream wellconfined meandering segment and an upstream lowsinuosity segment. These new insights regarding spatial differences along an incising channel can improve interpretations of the evolution of ancient planforms and floodplains that responded to baselevel decline. 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The geomorphic evolution of the Jordan River in recent decades indicates that interaction between incision and highmagnitude floods controls sinuosity changes under increasing mouth gradients during baselevel fall. Near the river mouth, in a confining segment, overbank flooding is less likely and high shear stress results in increased sinuosity. Upstream, where incision is more moderate and floods overtop the banks, meander chute cutoffs are favored and result in lowsinuosity segments."
4,4.0,0.4811,"model, scale, spatial, base, approach, predict, estimate, develop, method, distribution","Regional regression models of percentile flows for the contiguous US: Expert versus data-driven independent variable selection Percentile flows are statistics derived from the flow duration curve (FDC) that describe the flow equaled or exceeded for a given percent of time. These statistics provide important information for managing rivers, but are often unavailable since most basins are ungauged. A common approach for predicting percentile flows is to deploy regional regression models based on gauged percentile flows and related independent variables derived from physical and climatic data. The first step of this process identifies groups of basins through a cluster analysis of the independent variables, followed by the development of a regression model for each group. This entire process hinges on the independent variables selected to summarize the physical and climatic state of basins. Distributed physical and climatic datasets now exist for the contiguous United States (US). However, it remains unclear how to best represent these data for the development of regional regression models. The study presented here developed regional regression models for the contiguous US, and evaluated the effect of different approaches for selecting the initial set of independent variables on the predictive performance of the regional regression models. An expert assessment of the dominant controls on the FDC was used to identify a small set of independent variables likely related to percentile flows. A data-driven approach was also applied to evaluate two larger sets of variables that consist of either (1) the averages of data for each basin or (2) both the averages and statistical distribution of basin data distributed in space and time. The small set of variables from the expert assessment of the FDC and two larger sets of variables for the data-driven approach were each applied for a regional regression procedure. Differences in predictive performance were evaluated using 184 validation basins withheld from regression model development. The small set of independent variables selected through expert assessment produced similar, if not better, performance than the two larger sets of variables. A parsimonious set of variables only consisted of mean annual precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and baseflow index. Additional variables in the two larger sets of variables added little to no predictive information. Regional regression models based on the parsimonious set of variables were developed using 734 calibration basins, and were converted into a tool for predicting 13 percentile flows in the contiguous US. Supplementary Material for this paper includes an R graphical user interface for predicting the percentile flows of basins within the range of conditions used to calibrate the regression models. The equations and performance statistics of the models are also supplied in tabular form."
5,5.0,0.5933,"process, system, understand, study, role, important, structure, provide, complex, interaction",III: Medium: Collaborative Research: Citing Structured and Evolving Data Citation is an essential part of scientific and scholarly publishing: it is used to gauge the trust placed in published data and for better or worse is an important factor in judging academic reputation. Now that much scientific publishing especially data publishing takes place through a database rather than conventional journals how should something that is found in a database be cited? More generally how should digital data that is stored in a repository with internal structure and which is subject to change be cited? This is the case for the very large number of curated databases through which much scientific publishing now takes place; it is also true of most scientific data collections which are seldom stable. There has recently been substantial interest in the problem of data citation and various organizations have proposed structures for the format and content of citations; however most proposals do not address issues of structure and change that are intrinsic to databases. The focus of this proposal is to develop a framework for data citation which takes into account the following issues: (1) the potentially very large number of possible citations; (2) citations should be both human and machine readable; and (3) citations must conform to specifications prescribed by both the publishers of the data and by the various standards that are being established. All these give rise to interesting computational challenges: citations must be generated automatically from the data; the source data must be guaranteed to support the generation of these citations; and the generated citations must be guaranteed to conform to the specifications. Of course as with any computational problem all this must be done efficiently. Citation is also closely related to provenance and issues of reproducible results. Workflows executable papers and microcitations have all been proposed to support reproducible analysis of data. The work of this project will explore the connections between these ideas and where possible establish a common framework. For many databases the publishers and authors have a clear idea of how they would like their data to be cited and there is enough information in the database to enable these citations to be generated once the right computational machinery has been developed. However interesting questions arise when a set of data to be cited is arrived at by means of a query in which case the query itself may need to be included (an actionable citation). In other cases the navigational structure needed for meaningful citation such as in the case with linked open data or RDF which are ostensibly large amorphous graphs may be missing. The challenge here is to find techniques for discovering or adding that structure to provide the necessary basis for citation. 
6,6.0,0.5877,"specie, population, community, effect, diversity, abundance, individual, ecosystem, biomass, find",Collaborative Research: Demographic heterogeneity in landscapes and communities Variation in phenotypic traits occurs within all populations. This in turn creates variation in demo- graphic traits — the propensity to survive more or less or to have more or fewer offspring (contrast with the actual life history an organism experiences — its demographic fate; see Kendall & Fox 2003) as well as individual growth and dispersal rates. While ecologists do use models (like linear matrix models) that classify individuals by age stage or size and sex most assume that in doing so they have captured suffi- cient variation so that further variation is simply noise of small amplitude. This is not necessarily the case. This variation in traits occurs even when within categories such as age stage size or sex. We use the term demographic heterogeneity to refer collectively to the variation in birth death growth and dispersal rates among individuals in an age stage or size class. Demographic heterogeneity can be produced by various mechanisms including genetic variabil- ity(Yashin et al. 1999 Ducrocq et al. 2000 Gerdes et al. 2000 Casellas et al. 2004 Isberg et al. 2006)spatial heterogeneity in the habitat(Gates and Gysel 1978 Boulding and Van Alstyne 1993 Menge et al. 1994 Winter et al. 2000 Franklin et al. 2000 Manolis et al. 2002 Bollinger and Gavin 2004 Landis et al. 2005) unequal allocation of parental care(e.g. Johnstone 2004; Manser&Avey 2000) seed heter- omorphisims(e.g. Silvertown 1984; Venable &Burquez M 1990) maternal family effect (Fox et al. 2006) learned feeding preferences (Bolnick et al. 2003) and social rank (e.g. von Holst Hutzelmeyer &Kaetzke 2002). Demographic heterogeneity is taxonomically widespread. For example heterogeneity in survival has been found in crocodiles (Isberg et al. 2006) baboons (Bronikowski et al. 2002) birds (Wintrebert et al. 2005 Fox et al. 2006) wild plants (Beckage and Clark 2003 Landis et al. 2005) domestic ani- mals(Ducrocq et al. 2000 Casellas et al. 2004) and humans(Yashin et al. 1999 Garibotti et al. 2006) including British aristocrats(Doblhammer and Oeppen 2003). Demographic heterogeneity has been shown to have a variety of effects on population dynamics. Heterogeneity in survival and reproduction can change the population variabliltydue to demographic sto- chasticity often reducing it relative to a homogeneous population with the same average rates. Hetero- geneity in survival if it persists throughout the life cycle creates cohort selection which in turn increases the asymptotic population growth rate and equilibrium population densities. Finally heterogeneity in dispersal ability can increase the rate at which an invading population spreads. 
7,7.0,0.6014,"snow, surface, satellite, measurement, observation, estimate, algorithm, product, soil_moisture, water","Water Vapor Retrieval Over Cloud Cover Area on Land Using AMSR-E and MODIS This study mainly discusses atmospheric water vapor retrieval over cloud cover area on land with the help of a newly developed surface emissivity parameter estimation method in microwave bands. In the retrieval method, the atmospheric water vapor sensitivity parameterratio of brightness temperature polarization difference at frequencies 18.7 and 23.8 GHz (${{\Deltab}} {\bf Tb}_{\bf 18.7}/{{\Deltab}} {\bf Tb}_{\bf 23.8}$)is used to retrieve water vapor, and the surface emissivity parameterratio of surface emissivity polarization difference at frequencies 18.7 and 23.8 GHz (${{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 18.7}}/{{\Deltab}} {\varepsilonb}_{\bf 23.8}$) that corresponds to ${{\Deltab}} {\bf Tb}_{\bf18.7}/{{\Deltab}} {\bf Tb}_{\bf 23.8}$is a key parameter that affects the final precision of retrieved atmosphere water vapor. In order to estimate ${{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 18.7}}/{{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 23.8}}$ in cloudy condition, we first estimated the value of ${{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 18.7}}/{{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 23.8}}$ in clear condition using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) brightness temperature and related MODIS atmospheric products. At the same time, it was found that gradient information derived separately from ${{\Deltab}} {\bf Tb}_{\bf 18.7}/{{\Deltab}} {\bf Tb}_{\bf 23.8}$ and ${{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 18.7}}/{{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 23.8}}$ has very good correlation with each other. Based on this good correlation, the ${{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 18.7}}/{{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 23.8}}$ in cloudy condition was estimated using corresponding ${{\Deltab}} {\bf Tb}_{\bf 18.7}/{{\Deltab}} {\bf Tb}_{\bf 23.8}$ and adjacent 8 days ${{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 18.7}}/{{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 23.8}}$ in clear condition. With the estimated ${{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 18.7}}/{{\Deltab}} {{\varepsilonb}_{\bf 23.8}}$, we retrieved atmospheric column water vapor using lookup table method in cloudy condition over land. As a validation source data, the SuomiNet GPS-retrieved precipitable water (PW) vapor is used to validate the retrieved water vapor in this study. According to validation, the correlation coefficient of the two is 0.94 and the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) is 4.85 mm. It is a great improvement in water vapor retrieval using microwave in cloud cover area on land."

The borehole program is highly leveraged taking advantage of the resources of other programs and agencies that are active in monitoring southern California earthquake activity. This data is made available online to the public and research community. The SCEC borehole data gathering effort is contributing to the overall scientific goals of the SCEC collaboratory. For example the borehole data available online at the SCEDC and at IRIS from the SCEC/PBO stations in the Anza region are providing a unique new high-resolution data set for analysis of earthquake source parameters (Priority A4) as well as providing observations of non-volcanic tremor induced events in the region following large regional and very large global earthquakes. In addition the borehole instrumentation is critical to improving our understanding of nonlinear effects and to developing methodologies to include these effects into ground motion simulations (Priority B4 B5). As has been the case for many years joint monitoring efforts continue between SCEC and the US Geological Survey and Caltech through ANSS NSMP and CISN and the California Geological Survey to maintain the existing network of borehole stations. Other collaborators include the NSF funded NEES and HPWREN programs as well as a newly funded NSF project to look at the San Jacinto Fault zone including the installation of additional borehole sensors. In 2011 SCEC borehole stations will continue to be upgraded along with the CISN network stations in southern California. This includes migration to new datalogger technology and the upgrade of surface sensors. As the SCEC borehole stations come up on the schedule for network wide upgrades we will continue to work with the SCSN field technicians during the upgrade process. The SCEC borehole program will also continue the collaboration with the NEES program (Priority B6) through processing and data dissemination of the SCEC borehole data; the SCEC/EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory borehole strainmeter program that includes both weak- and strong-motion seismic monitoring in the Anza region; and the strong-motion borehole sensors being installed as part of a new NSF funded study of the San Jacinto fault zone.
9,9.0,0.5921,"soil, plant, ecosystem, forest, fire, water, effect, increase, drought, vegetation",Collaborative Research: Controls over C Sequestration: Physiology vs. Physics In this project we will focus on an annual grassland to evaluate the mechanisms that regulate the fate of C. Grasslands in California cover over 10 million hectares (Jackson 1985) are dominated by annual grasses and are important ecosystems in the State. However we have found comparable microbial dynamics in California grassland and Bishop pine forest so we have confidence that the mechanisms we evaluate occur in other ecosystem types as well. The research will take place at the UCSB Sedgwick Reserve which is located 50 km from the coast in the Santa Ynez Valley (43o42??30????N 120o2??30????W). The climate is Mediterranean and characteristic of interior California with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Average rainfall is 380 mm/yr but varies widely; El Niño years are notably rainy. The soils are pachic argixerolls in valley bottoms and typic argixerolls on slopes. The vegetation is dominated by Mediterranean annual grasses including Bromus diandrus B. hordaceous and Avena fatua. Our main site will be in the Figueroa watershed previously studied by Schimel and Holden. Analyzing the mechanisms involved requires controlled microcosm experiments that will be described below but to explore how these mechanisms regulate how varying plant C inputs and moisture influence soil C storage we propose a field experiment in which we modify: 1) plant C- inputs during the growing season (by thinning) and 2) the length of the dry season (by watering & rainout shelters). We will establish 3 blocks of 16 plots each (1 m x 1m) and establish a factorial design in which we create gradients of plant inputs and the length of the summer drought. We will use modeling to integrate between the micro- and macro-scales. To modify plant inputs we will thin plots by hand to remove either 1/3 2/3 or all the biomass (plus a control). Plots will be established initially after plants germinate in the fall of 2012 and new sprouts will be removed weekly or as necessary to maintain these approximate proportions. Soil moisture is likely to vary as transpiration losses will be lower in the thinned plots but surface evaporation may partially compensate. Importantly annual grasses senescence and die shortly after seed-set not when the soils dry out. Thus at the beginning of the summer there will be a suite of plots with different amounts of dead roots to serve as substrate within the soils with relatively similar moisture conditions (depending on the timing of spring rainfall). Dry-down after senescence will be purely by evaporation. Moisture manipulations will include control lengthened summer drought shortened drought and no drought. To extend the drought we will build rainout shelters to prevent rewetting during the winter following the thinning treatments. To shorten the drought we will use weekly drip irrigation. The goal is not to keep soils constantly wet but to mimic episodic precipitation and prevent soils from drying fully. The short-drought treatment will be irrigated into July then allowed to dry normally roughly halving the length of the typical drought. The no-drought treatment will be watered into October. We will regularly weed the watered-plots during the summer to remove new sprouts. Soil moisture will be monitored continuously (using soil moisture probes and dataloggers) in the experimental plots. Soil samples will be collected from all treatments to analyze C dynamics at four points through the year: 1) At peak live plant biomass late in the growing season (April/May) 2) early summer (just before the short-drought watering ends; late June) 3) midsummer (August) and 4) the end of the dry season (October or early January for the extended drought treatment). We will collect samples from the top 10 cm and analyze the essential C pools including roots light and heavy fraction OM microbial biomass etc. As these measures will be coupled to the work specifically testing the research hypotheses we describe the details of those analyses in those sections. The field sampling will assess how environmental factors (C-supply and moisture) regulate C-pools and microbial activities and the begin identifying the mechanisms connecting them. We will couple these to laboratory incubation studies to tease apart the specific mechanisms.

The primary focus is to estimate the relative contribution of on and off-fault dissipation mechanism to the total energy budget. We will start by investigating the conditions under which a steady slip pulse can propagate on a velocity- weakening friction interface embedded in an elasto-plastic bulk. Steady propagation will allow us to examine the relationship between the width of the plastically deforming zone surrounding the fault and the constant width of the slip pulse. Because steady propagation does not emit radiated energy accurate bounds can be placed in this case on the energy dissipated in the inelastic and frictional processes. Steady propagation will also allow us to investigate in a more systematic way the effect of perturbations in the material properties material response and prestress on the rupture dynamics including variability in rupture speed maximum slip rate and ultimately rupture arrest. We will also address several seismologically-relevant questions. For example we will be examine the effect of off-fault plasticity on seismic observables like rupture speed acceleration to limiting speed in sub-shear ruptures transition to super shear and slip rate functions (in terms of the maximum and the average values of slip rates). Moreover we will also be able to assess the impact of off-fault dissipation on the high frequency content of ground motion. This is relevant for developing physically-based models for ground motion prediction. The project will accomplish the following tasks: a. Quantify the magnitude of on- and off-fault dissipation and their relative contribution to the earthquake energy budget for different friction laws (rate and state law/slip weakening law). b. Constrain the absolute levels of prestress consistent with the different modes of ruptures (cracks vs pulses) with and without the presence of off-fault dissipation mechanisms. c. Investigate the effect of off-fault dissipation on high frequency ground motion

This method evaluation study examined the specificity and sensitivity of 41 MST methodologies by analyzing data generated in 27 laboratories. MST methodologies that targeted human, cow, ruminant, dog, gull, pig, horse, and sheep were tested against sewage, septage, human, cow, dog, deer, pig, chicken, pigeon, gull, horse, and goose fecal samples. Each laboratory received 64 blind samples containing a single source (singletons) or two sources (doubletons), as well as diluted singleton samples to assess method sensitivity. Laboratories utilized their own protocols when performing the methods and data were deposited in a central database before samples were unblinded. Between one and seven laboratories tested each method. The most sensitive and specific assays, based on an analysis of presence/absence of each marker in target and non-target fecal samples, were HF183 endpoint and HF183SYBR (human), CF193 and Rum2Bac (ruminant), CowM2 and CowM3 (cow), BacCan (dog), Gull2SYBR and LeeSeaGull (gull), PF163 and pigmtDNA (pig), HoF597 (horse), PhyloChip (pig, horse, chicken, deer), Universal 16S TRFLP (deer), and Bacteroidales 16S TRFLP (pig, horse, chicken, deer); all had sensitivity and specificity higher than 80% in all or the majority of laboratories. When the abundance of MST markers in target and non-target fecal samples was examined, some assays that performed well in the binary analysis were found to not be sensitive enough as median concentrations fell below a minimum abundance criterion (set at 50 copies per colony forming units of enterococci) in target fecal samples. Similarly, some assays that cross-reacted with non-target fecal sources in the binary analysis were found to perform well in a quantitative analysis because the cross-reaction occurred at very low levels. Based on a quantitative analysis, the best performing methods were HF183Taqman and BacH (human), Rum2Bac and BacR (ruminant), LeeSeaGull (gull), and Pig2Bac (pig); no cow or dog-specific assay met the quantitative specificity and sensitivity criteria. Some of the best performing assays in the study were run by just one laboratory so further testing of assay portability is needed. While this study evaluated the marker performance in defined samples, further field testing as well as development of frameworks for fecal source allocation and risk assessment are needed."

Precipitation data are obtained from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) in pentads during 23 austral summers (DecemberFebruary 1979/802001/02). Extreme wet (dry) events are defined according to 75th (25th) percentiles of precipitation anomaly distributions observed in two time scales: intraseasonal and interannual. The agreement between the 25th and 75th percentiles of the GPCP precipitation and gridded precipitation obtained from stations in Brazil is also examined. Variations of extreme wet and dry anomalies on interannual time scales are investigated along with variations of sea surface temperature (SST) and circulation anomalies. The South Atlantic SST dipole seems related to interannual variations of extreme precipitation events over southeastern Brazil. It is shown that extreme wet and dry events in the continental portion of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) are decoupled from extremes over the oceanic portion of the SACZ and there is no coherent dipole of extreme precipitation regimes between tropics and subtropics on interannual time scales. On intraseasonal time scales, the occurrence of extreme dry and wet events depends on the propagation phase of extratropical wave trains and consequent intensification (weakening) of 200-hPa zonal winds. Extreme wet and dry events over southeastern Brazil and subtropical Atlantic are in phase on intraseasonal time scales. Extreme wet events over southeastern Brazil and subtropical Atlantic are observed in association with low-level northerly winds above the 75th percentile of the seasonal climatology over central-eastern South America. Extreme wet events on intraseasonal time scales over southeastern Brazil are more frequent during seasons not classified as extreme wet or dry on interannual time scales."

Direct measurement of the in-water solar flux divergence, or radiant heating rates, allows variations in solar forcing of stratification, that can be significant, to be accurately quantified (e.g. Ohlmann et al. 1996, Ohlmann et al. 1998, Ohlmann et al. 2000, Hosegood et al. 2008). Solar attenuation depends primarily on upper ocean chlorophyll biomass concentration in open ocean waters. Chlorophyll biomass depends (to first order) on the availability of light and nutrients. When measured together, these data inform on bio-physical feedbacks. This statement of work describes the proposed measurement of surface irradiance and in water solar flux profiles during the Dynamo field experiment. Collecting solar flux profiles allows upper ocean stratification, an important component of upper ocean mixed layer evolution, to be quantified. It is also proposed that water samples be collected for laboratory analysis of chlorophyll biomass and nutrients. These data are 152 necessary to understand why the in-water solar flux divergence varies, and the sampling adds little cost to the project. Upper ocean models work with solar transmission, defined as solar flux at depth relative to the incident value just above the surface. Surface irradiance will thus be sampled with a radiometer mounted on the ship’s mast. The complete data set, to be collected throughout the MJO-evolution cruises, will provide the necessary solar transmission information for accurate quantification of upper-ocean mixing, and will allow the bio-physical influence on stratification/dissipation to be better understood. Profiles of downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance in 11 spectral bands (~300 to ~700 nm) will be measured using a Satlantic Profiler II Radiometer (www.satlantic.com/profiler). The radiometer is a long (122 cm) slender (9 cm in diameter) hand-deployed freefalling instrument (retrieved using a small winch) that eludes ship motion and shadow. Coincident measurements of downwelling spectral irradiance and total solar radiation incident at the surface will be made so that solar transmission profiles can be computed. It is estimated that solar flux profiles will be made to ~40 meters every few hours each day. It is possible that profiles in the morning and evening hours, when total solar energy is reduced, can be made shallower. Water samples at discrete depths will be collected once each day with the ship’s CTD/Rosette system and analyzed for chlorophyll concentration and nutrients. The noontime CTD/Rosette casts will be performed to ~150 meters so that the deep chlorophyll maximum and nutricline are resolved. The radiometer primarily resolves the visible portion of the entire solar spectrum. This is sufficient to resolve the solar flux at depths beneath ~5 m as energy in the ultra-violet and near-infrared spectral regions is completely attenuated in the top few meters of the ocean."

Olivine-hosted melt inclusions (inclusions hereafter) are trapped by growing phenocrysts in magma conduits at depth and provide snapshots of diverse melt compositions before complete melt aggregation. Inclusions reveal major and trace element diversity that is not clear from analyses of whole rock lavas alone and the origin of this diversity continues to be a source of vigorous debate. One end member hypothesis is that the diversity in inclusions reflects heterogeneity in mantle source compositions. Alternatively the diversity of inclusion compositions may result from magmatic processes including crustal assimilation. In a groundbreaking discovery extreme Pb-isotopic variabilityspanning 50% of the range identified in global ocean island and MORB lavaswas measured in olivine hosted melt inclusions from a single lava collected from the island of Mangaia (Cook Austral Islands). While many of the Mangaia inclusions host a Pb-isotopic component similar to lavas from the island a surprising result was that some inclusions host less radiogenic Pb-isotopic ratios never before seen in Mangaian lavas. The origin of the Pb isotopic diversity in these inclusions is not well understood and the discovery of isotopic variability gave rise to a host of fundamental questions. Why is it that the inclusions are not isotopically representative of the bulk magma? Is it because inclusions from a single lava trap melts from isotopically-diverse mantle sources? Or does the isotopic diversity reflect assimilation of the lithosphere during magma ascent? Unfortunately bulk abundances of elements most sensitive to crustal assimilation (like B Cl and K) have never been paired with Pb-isotopic compositions in the same inclusions from Mangaia. As a result it has not been possible to evaluate whether the Pb-isotopic variability in Mangaia inclusions relates to mantle source variability or crustal assimilation. In an attempt to evaluate the origin of the isotopic variability in inclusions from Mangaia the PI used start-up funds to undertake a pilot study with his student (Ms. Rita Cabral) in which 14 inclusions from Mangaia were analyzed for major trace and volatile elements. The data from the pilot study are intriguing and hint at a possible role for crustal assimilation. However the data are limited and robust conclusions cannot be drawn without additional data and mantle source variability is possible. In particular Pb-isotopic measurements on the inclusions are necessary to determine whether proxies for crustal assimilation relate to the Pb-isotopic variability. Thus this proposal seeks funding to make additional measurements to test the following hypotheses: 1.) If the Pb isotopic diversity in Mangaia inclusions is a result of crustal assimilation processes the Pb-isotopic compositions will correlate with indices of assimilation (e.g. high Cl and B). 2.) Alternatively the isotopic diversity in Mangaia inclusions reflects diverse mantle sources beneath Mangaia that contribute isotopically-heterogeneous melts to inclusions. To test these hypotheses this proposal seeks funding to measure 87Sr/86Sr (which is also sensitive to assimilation of seawater and crustal materials) and Pb isotopic ratios and major trace and volatile abundances in the same inclusions and expand the study to include a larger suite of inclusions from three Mangaia lavas. The proposed measurements will constrain the relative roles of magmatic processes and mantle sources in generating heterogeneous inclusions and will be important for understanding magma transport and emplacement processes in the lithosphere.

From 2005 to 2009, cotton area harvested in the USA nearly halved with a reduction of 2.5 million hectares, while that of corn increased by 1.8 million hectares. However, environmental impacts of land shifts from cotton and corn have been largely neglected in literature. In this study, we evaluate the environmental properties of US corn and cotton production and implications of land cover change from cotton to corn using state-specific data and life cycle impact assessment. Focusing on regional environmental issues, we cover both on-farm direct emissions such as different types of volatile organic compounds and pesticides and indirect emissions embodied in input materials such as fertilizers. TRACI 2.0 is used to evaluate the environmental impacts of these emissions. The results show that US cotton and corn productions per hectare on average generate roughly similar impacts for most impact categories such as eutrophication and smog formation. For water use and freshwater ecotoxicity, corn shows a smaller impact. When land shifts from cotton to corn in cotton-growing states, however, the process may aggravate most of the regional environmental impacts while relieving freshwater ecotoxicity impact. The differences in the two estimates are due mainly to underlying regional disparities in crop suitability that affects input structure and environmental emissions. Our results highlight the importance of potential, unintended environmental impacts that cannot be adequately captured when average data are employed. Understanding the actual mechanisms under which certain policy induces marginal changes at a regional and local level is crucial for evaluating its net impact. Further, our study calls for an attention to biofuel-induced land cover change between crops and associated regional environmental impacts."
17,17.0,0.665,"california, area, coastal, habitat, site, provide, include, large, support, restoration","Research and Restoration at Casmalia Landfill: Ecosystem Evaluation and Restoration for Species Recovery The Casmalia Landfill Superfund Site is located approximately 10 miles southwest of the city of Santa Maria in Santa Barbara County, California. The site was owned and operated by Casmalia Resources and accepted approximately 5.6 billion pounds of waste between 1973 and 1989. Waste disposal units at the site included: 6 landfills for pesticides/solvents, metals, caustic/cyanides, acids, and non-liquid polychlorinated biphenyls; 43 surface impoundments; 15 evaporation pads; 2 non-hazardous waste spreading areas; 6 oil field spreading areas; 11 shallow injection wells; 7 disposal trenches; 1 drum burial unit; and 6 landfills. The site supports five stormwater ponds that may serve as an attractive nuisance to wildlife. The federally endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense) and federally threatened Calfornia red-legged frog (Rana draytonii) have been detected at the site. In 2001 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) entered into an agreement with EPA to extend a covenant not to sue for Natural Resource Damages to potentially responsible parties as part of a de minimis settlement. The Service received $178,250 in settlement funds in exchange for the issuance of the covenant not to sue. The Service intends to use these funds to conduct restoration that will benefit the California red-legged frog, California tiger salamander, and other trust resources. Biological surveys were conducted in the late 1990s and early 2000s in support of EPA’s ecological risk assessment and remedial investigation. Updated surveys are necessary in order to determine current usage of the site by our trust resources, and to best guide the use of the limited settlement dollars available to conduct restoration. The Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office proposes to use the requested funding to conduct surveys for the California red-legged frog and California tiger salamander in strategic locations within the site and surrounding habitats to determine current usage of the site by these species. Surveys for California red-legged frogs were previously conducted in 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. Surveys for California tiger salamanders were conducted in 2002/2003, and 2004/2005. California red-legged frogs were detected in all survey efforts with the exception of 2004. California tiger salamanders were detected during drift fence surveys in 2004/2005. Because California tiger salamander surveys have never been replicated at the site in the six years since the species was detected, and because the species is so acutely imperiled within Santa Barbara County, information about presence or absence of the species at the Casmalia Resources site would be invaluable. In addition, previous surveys for California tiger salamanders 210 established presence of metamorphosed individuals in upland habitat, but the extent of California tiger salamander breeding in aquatic resources at the site remains unknown. The trend in observations of California red-legged frogs throughout the 1998 to 2004 study period demonstrated a rapid decline from over 50 individuals detected in 1998 to no individuals detected in 2003 or 2004. The absence of California red-legged frogs in 2003 and 2004 is suspected to be associated with low water levels in the stormwater ponds due to pumping of water for the construction of a landfill cap, and increasing total dissolved solids (TDS) in the stormwater ponds. The water level in all ponds is currently high relative to 2003/2004, however TDS remains high and the use of the ponds by California red-legged frogs and California tiger salamanders is unknown. It is likely that the high TDS is creating an attractive nuisance for the California tiger salamanders and California red-legged frogs attempting to breed at the site. This project will evaluate the need for (through aquatic and upland surveys) and feasibility of, creating additional breeding ponds at the site to provide suitable breeding habitat away from areas with high TDS. Ponds will subsequently be created as deemed appropriate and monitored in subsequent years. The proposed surveys will assist the Service in providing technical assistance to EPA during the remedial process, and implementing restoration for the California red-legged frog and California tiger salamander. Updated information about the use of the site by California tiger salamanders and California red-legged frogs will support the Service’s effort to work with EPA in evaluating and selecting a remedy that would provide maximum habitat for trust resources and understand the use of the site be these species. The study will be conducted in phases to achieve the overall objectives of the study."
18,18.0,0.6108,"mechanism, level, cell, plant, response, growth, material, form, enhance, oil","C60 Fullerols Enhance Copper Toxicity and Alter the Leaf Metabolite and Protein Profile in Cucumber. Abiotic and biotic stress induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which limit crop production. Little is known about ROS reduction through the application of exogenous scavengers. In this study, C60 fullerol, a free radical scavenger, was foliar applied to three-week-old cucumber plants (1 or 2 mg/plant) before exposure to copper ions (5 mg/plant). Results showed that C60 fullerols augmented Cu toxicity by increasing the influx of Cu ions into cells (170% and 511%, respectively, for 1 and 2 mg of C60 fullerols/plant). We further use metabolomics and proteomics to investigate the mechanism of plant response to C60 fullerols. Metabolomics revealed that C60 fullerols up-regulated antioxidant metabolites including 3-hydroxyflavone, 1,2,4-benzenetriol, and methyl trans-cinnamate, among others, while it down-regulated cell membrane metabolites (linolenic and palmitoleic acid). Proteomics analysis revealed that C60 fullerols up-regulated chloroplast proteins involved in water photolysis (PSII protein), light-harvesting (CAB), ATP production (ATP synthase), pigment fixation (Mg-PPIX), and electron transport ( Cyt b6f). Chlorophyll fluorescence measurement showed that C60 fullerols significantly accelerated the electron transport rate in leaves (13.3% and 9.4%, respectively, for 1 and 2 mg C60 fullerols/plant). The global view of the metabolic pathway network suggests that C60 fullerols accelerated electron transport rate, which induced ROS overproduction in chloroplast thylakoids. Plant activated antioxidant and defense pathways to protect the cell from ROS damaging. The revealed benefit (enhance electron transport) and risk (alter membrane composition) suggest a cautious use of C60 fullerols for agricultural application."
19,19.0,0.6972,"fault, rate, basin, km, fold, central, deformation, tectonic, time, range","Initiation of Sierra Nevada range front Walker Lane faulting ca. 12 Ma in the Ancestral Cascades arc The eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada (USA) forms one of the most prominent topographic and geologic features in the Cordillera, yet the timing and nature of fault displacements along it remain relatively poorly known. The central Sierra Nevada range front is an ideal place to determine the structural evolution of the range front because it has abundant dateable Cenozoic volcanic rocks. The Sonora Pass area of the central Sierra Nevada is particularly good for reconstructing the slip history of range-front faults, because it includes unusually widespread and distinctive high-K volcanic rocks (the ca. 11.59 Ma Stanislaus Group) that serve as outstanding strain markers. These include the following, from base to top. (1) The Table Mountain Latite (TML) consists of voluminous trachyandesite, trachybasaltic andesite, and basalt lava flows, erupted from fault-controlled fissures in the Sierra Crest graben-vent system. (2) The Eureka Valley Tuff consists of three trachydacite ignimbrite members erupted from the Little Walker caldera. These ignimbrites are interstratified with lava flows that continued to erupt from the Sierra Crest graben-vent system, and include silicic high-K as well as intermediate to mafic high-K lavas. The graben-vent system consists of a single º27-km-long, º810-km-wide approximately north-south graben that is along the modern Sierran crest between Sonora Pass and Ebbetts Pass, with a series of approximately north-south half-grabens on its western margin, and an º24-km-wide northeast transfer zone emanating from the northeast boundary of the graben on the modern range front south of Ebbetts Pass. In this paper we focus on the structural evolution of the Sonora Pass segment of the Sierra Nevada range front, which we do not include in the Sierra Crest graben-vent complex because we have found no vents for high-K lava flows here. However, we show that these faults localized the high-K Little Walker caldera. We demonstrate that the range-front faults at Sonora Pass were active before and during the ca. 11.59 Ma high-K volcanism. We show that these faults are dominantly approximately north-south down to the east normal faults, passing northward into a system of approximately northeast-southwest sinistral oblique normal faults that are on the southern end of the º24-km-wide northeast transfer zone in the Sierra Crest graben-vent complex. At least half the slip on the north-south normal faults on the Sonora Pass range front occurred before and during eruption of the TML, prior to development of the Little Walker caldera. It has previously been suggested that the range-front faults formed a right-stepping transtensional stepover that controlled the siting of the Little Walker caldera; we support that interpretation by showing that synvolcanic throw on the faults increases southward toward the caldera. The Sonora PassLittle Walker caldera area is shown here to be very similar in structural style and scale to the transtensional stepover at the Quaternary Long Valley field. Furthermore, the broader structural setting of both volcanic fields is similar, because both are associated with a major approximately northeast-southwest sinistral oblique normal fault zone. This structural style is typical of central Walker Lane belt transtension. Previous models have called for westward encroachment of Basin and Range extension into the Sierra Nevada range front after arc volcanism ceased (ca. 63.5 Ma); we show instead that Walker Lane transtension is responsible for the formation of the range front, and that it began by ca. 12 Ma. We conclude that Sierra Nevada range-front faulting at Sonora Pass initiated during high-K arc volcanism, under a Walker Lane transtensional strain regime, and that this controlled the siting of the Little Walker caldera."
